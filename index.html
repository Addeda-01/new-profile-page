                <p>Aha, you are here! I'm Adedamola Kolawole and my pen name is Addeda. Welcome to my website. You'll love it here—well, you 
                    should, if you don't feel uncomfortable about young women holding strong opinions and owning their experiences and stories 
                    without cowering. </p>
                <p>I love words, and I enjoy peppering my posts with unusual expressions. I love reading, too; novels and 
                    short stories most especially. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is my idol. Her book Americanah is one of the best things that have 
                    ever happened to me. </p>
                <p>There are lots of other things that I love, but talking to myself on the blog isn't one of them, so I look 
                    forward to reading your thoughts on issues raised here. Feel free to disagree at any time. I'm all for intellectual arguments. 
                    Have a good time!</p>

                <h2>TOP ARTICLES BY ADEDAMOLA KOLAWOLE</h2>
                <h3>FICTION REVIEW: You Sing of a Longing, by Otosirieze Obi-Young</h3>
                <p>One remarkable quality I'll ascribe to Otosirieze's short fiction, You Sing of a Longing, is audacity.</p> 
                <p>Writing about homosexuality at a time when it didn't enjoy the current level of tolerance, or better put, 
                indifference—that's some guts. (Recall the recurrent threats and physical attacks against gay right activists, Chibuihe Obi 
                and Romeo Oriogun sometime in 2017.)</p> 
                <p>Against this backdrop of almost non-existent Nigerian literature on gay sexuality, it is easy to see how it might have 
                been tedious trying to pull off an untold story depicting a most unusual love dynamic: one between a young man and another 
                old enough to be his father; an authority he looked up to, at that. <em>Read more <a href=https://medium.com/@kolawole.adedamola2309/fiction-review-you-sing-of-a-longing-by-otosirieze-obi-young-bbf835dd0933">here</a></em></p>
                    
                <h3>FEARFUL FAITH AND BRAVE EXITS</h3>
                <p>What is it about death that is so unfortunate, especially for a person who is privileged enough to be the orchestrator of 
                his own exit?</p>
                <p>I don't think I would want people to desecrate my corpse with sad tears should I take the bold step and take my life in my 
                own hands, literally.</p>
                <p>I don't know why people who live a hopeless life, people who don't have anything strong to hold on to in times of adversity 
                (Jesus, love, family, friendship, etc.) think they are better off than the dead just by virtue of being alive.</p>
                <p>If you are a Nigerian, everything will conspire to frustrate you. That’s why you must have money/influence in order to 
                escape most of the hardships. If you can’t have those, at least have faith in something bigger than you. Most of the 
                objects of our faith may be unreal, but they work just fine. Just like placebos. But to be a nobody and snub faith is 
                intentional and foolish sufferhead. It’s why I laugh at Nigerian atheists. <em>Read more <a href=https://medium.com/@kolawole.adedamola2309/how-are-you-brave-when-the-only-thing-that-keeps-you-alive-is-the-morbid-fear-of-death-295f1d0ff724

                <h3>AN ANGRY BIRD’S DISJOINTED RANT ON CONTENT WRITING, NEGOTIATION AND SELF-WORTH</h3>
                <p>See, writers have suffered, and unless they (I do not consider myself much of a writer yet) begin to put their foot 
                down where it really matters, this 1-dollar-per-10k-click payment offer (and its many variants) will yet be the 
                beginning of the ridiculous propositions they’ll be subjected to.</p>
                <p>I remember when an acquaintance who had heard about my level of proficiency in English asked me to please proofread and 
                abridge a document for him. Final product was to be a 1000-word piece. Guess how much he offered to pay for my effort. 
                A miserable thousand naira. A thousand naira to compensate for the time I’d spend on Google, grammar books, dictionaries 
                and thesauari just to give his work a fine finish? I had never felt so insulted in a long time. <em>Read more <a href=
